# Brillio-Practicum
This is my Practicum - my final project - for the Business Analytics program at Santa Clara University.  

At a high level, our project is meant to give marketing teams a way to quantify the effectiveness of displaying their logo during sporting events.  It breaks down images videos into a series of images, and then classifies these images using CNNs.  For this example, our final model was trained on detecting Statefarm logos during NBA games, but this approach could work for different logos and different sporting events.
